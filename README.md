# Falsehoods Programmers Believe About Smalltalk based technologies

> Falsehood articles are a form of commentary on a particular subject, and are appreciated by the developer community at large for their effectiveness and terseness. They’re a convenient written form to approach an unfamiliar domain by dispelling myths, point out common pitfalls, show inconsistencies and subtleties.
> In a sense, Falsehood articles are a suite of wordy unit-tests covering extensive edge-cases provided by real-world usage.

# General Myths

  - Smalltalk is obsolete.
  - Smalltalk is a programming language.
  - It doesn't work for real-world development.
  - All Smalltalk flavors are image-based.
  - A Smalltalk Image cannot be bootstrapped.
  - All Smalltalks includes UI classes.
  - All implementations uses green threads.
  - Smalltalk is not used in Big Data Science.
  - You cannot use Smalltalk from command line.
  - There are few libraries in the ecosystem.
  - Most implementations do not support Full Closures.
  - Most implementations do not support executable generation.
  - There are no implementations supporting native widgets.
  
# Reflection Myths
  
  - Metaclasses are necessary to have a working Smalltalk.
  - ClassDescription is necessary.
  - Behavior is necessary.
  - Subclassing Behavior has no use. 
  - You cannot add hidden behavior to a method.
  - You can add it, but you need to recompile the method.
  - It is impossible to avoid a hierarchy recompilation when an instance variable is added to a class.

# VM Myths

  - All Smalltalk bytecode sets are stack-based VM.
  - All VM implementations uses bytecodes.

# GC & Efficency Myths

  - Smalltalk is less efficient than "low-level" languages.
  - Smalltalk can't do "real time."
  - Garbage collection is less efficient than manual memory management.
  - Garbage collection is really slow if you use complex data structures.
